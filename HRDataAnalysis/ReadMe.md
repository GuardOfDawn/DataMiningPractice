This is a data set describing the features of employees of a company. Most of them work pretty well. However, some employees have left due to some reasons. So, why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? We try to figure out it by performing data analysis and data mining on the data set. Features are as follows: satisfaction level, last evaluation level, number of projects the employee has ever worked in, average monthly hours, years spent at the company, whether the employee has had a work accident, whether the employee has had a promotion in the last 5 years, the employeeâ€™s department, the salary level and whether the employee has left.
